# Mapping Earthquakes

## Background

Scenario: We are a team in the Data Department of the United States Geological Survey and we are interested in building a new set of tools that will allow us to visualize earthquake data. We at USGS collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day and hope that being able to visualize this data will allow us to better educate the public and other government organizations.

Tools: Leaflet, GeoJSON, JavaScript, HTML, CSS

## Ploting the Earthquakes

1. **Getting The Data**

   The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. To access it, visit the [USGS GeoJSON Feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) page.

   The USGS earthquake data comes in the GeoJSON format.

2. **Making The Map**

   Using Leaflet to make a map that plots all of the earthquakes from the USGS dataset.

### Ploting the Tectonic Plates

The leadership at the USGS Data Department liked our first map and wants us to update it to better illustrate the causal relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity. 

Data on tectonic plates can be found [here](https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates).
