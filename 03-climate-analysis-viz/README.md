Scenario: We're going on a holiday vacation to Honolulu, Hawaii, and we need to do some trip planning. We're going to conduct a climate analysis using a database of Honolulu, Hawaii's historical climate to make sure the weather will be nice when we visit then build a Flask API to vizualize the insights from our analysis.

Tools: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Jupyter, SQLAlchemy, SQLite, and Flask.
