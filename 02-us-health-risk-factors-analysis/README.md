Scenario: We're on a data team for a major metropolitan newspaper and we've been tasked with sifting through the latest information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System to analyze current trends shaping people's lives and health risks facing particular demographics. We will make graphs and interactive elements to help readers understand our findings.
